**response:**

<think>
The user is asking for stock symbols to look at for the next opening day based on previous day's stock data. I need to look through the search results for specific stock symbols that were mentioned as recommendations for October 2025.

Looking at the search results:

From result [1] - "5 Stocks to Buy HEAVY Before October 2025":
- HOOD (Robinhood stock) - has major catalysts including upcoming banking and PDT rule removal
- QLGN (Qualigen Therapeutics stock) - getting into crypto space with C10 crypto treasury
- NVDA (Nvidia stock) - AI chip powerhouse getting into AI datacenters
- OPEN (Opendoor stock) - about to turn profitable, will benefit from lower fed rates
- TSLA (Tesla stock) - has catalysts including Robotaxi and Optimus Bot

From result [3] - "The 8 BEST Stocks I'm Buying Before October":
This mentions companies but doesn't give specific ticker symbols in the excerpt, though it references Palantir, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google.

From result [5] - "5 of the BEST Stocks to BUY in October":
- VST (Vistra Corp) - utility sector, AI theme, up 82% over past 12 months

The current date is October 1, 2025, so these recommendations are very timely since they were made in late September 2025 specifically for October 2025.

I should structure the answer as requested with symbols first, then explanation.
</think>

symbols: [HOOD, QLGN, NVDA, OPEN, TSLA, VST]

output: Based on recent analysis from late September 2025, these symbols represent strong opportunities for the next opening day. **Robinhood (HOOD)** has significant catalysts including upcoming banking services and the removal of the pattern day trading rule[1]. **Qualigen Therapeutics (QLGN)** is positioning itself in the crypto space with their new C10 crypto treasury and crypto index[1].

**Nvidia (NVDA)** continues to dominate the AI chip space and is expanding into AI datacenters, making it a powerhouse in the artificial intelligence sector[1]. **Opendoor (OPEN)** is approaching profitability and stands to benefit significantly from anticipated lower federal interest rates[1]. **Tesla (TSLA)** has multiple upcoming catalysts including their Robotaxi technology and Optimus Bot developments[1].

**Vistra Corp (VST)** represents an interesting utility sector play tied to the AI theme, as the company provides power solutions for the growing number of data centers being built for large language models. The stock has shown strong performance with an 82% gain over the past 12 months and nearly 40% year-to-date growth[5].

These selections span multiple sectors including fintech, biotech/crypto, semiconductors, real estate technology, electric vehicles, and utilities, providing diversified exposure to key growth themes like AI, crypto, and the anticipated fed rate cuts that were expected to benefit markets in October 2025.
