# Feature Ideas for COsuDE Typing Game

## Scoring System
- Award points per word (e.g., 10 * word length)
- Bonuses for speed (time-based multiplier)
- Combos for consecutive completions
- Display score, high score, and level

## Lives/Health
- Add 3 lives
- Lose one if a word reaches the bottom untyped
- Game over when lives = 0, with restart option

## Levels/Difficulty
- Increase fall speed or word length every 10 words
- Add stages with themes (e.g., Rust keywords, animals)

## Power-Ups
- Randomly spawn bonuses like "Slow Time" (halve speed for 5s), "Clear" (remove bottom word), or "Multiplier" (double points for 10s)

## Sound Effects
- Typing key presses
- Word completion chimes
- Failure buzzes
- Background music with increasing tempo

## Visual Enhancements
- Particle effects on completion (e.g., sparkles)
- Word animations (slight wiggle)
- Progress bar or timer

## Word Variety
- Multiple lists (programming, food, cities) selectable at start
- Randomize order or add special "boss" words

## UI Improvements
- Show next word preview
- Typing accuracy percentage
- Streak counter

## Game Modes
- Time attack (type as many as possible in 60s)
- Endless (survive as long as possible)
- Challenge (only hard words)
