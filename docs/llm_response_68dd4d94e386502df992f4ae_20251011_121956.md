<think>
The user is asking for stock symbols to look at on the next opening day based on previous day's stock data. They want the answer structured in a specific format with symbols and explanation.

Looking at the search results, I can see several YouTube videos discussing stocks to buy in October 2025. The current date is October 1, 2025, so these recommendations are timely. Let me extract the stock symbols mentioned:

From search result [1]:
- HOOD (Robinhood)
- QLGN (Qualigen Therapeutics) 
- NVDA (Nvidia)
- OPEN (Opendoor)
- TSLA (Tesla)

From search result [3]:
- AVGO (Broadcom)
- CRWD (CrowdStrike)
- ANET (Arista Networks)
- TTD (The Trade Desk)
- ETH (Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust)

From search result [5]:
- Mentions Palantir and Microsoft/Google but doesn't give specific tickers in the snippet

I should structure this according to the user's requested format and provide explanations for why these symbols are worth looking at.
