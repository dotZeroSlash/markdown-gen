Create a Step by Step guide on how to create a small simulation using godot engine and AI/LLM

**answer:** Creating a Simulation in Godot with AI/LLM Integration

Godot Engine provides multiple pathways for integrating large language models into simulations, from local AI models using Ollama to cloud-based API services. This step-by-step guide covers the complete workflow for building an AI-powered simulation.youtubegithub+1

Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following are installed and configured:algorythmacademyyoutube

Godot Engine 4.x (download from godotengine.org)

Ollama for local LLM hosting (or API keys for cloud services like OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, or Google Gemini)

Basic understanding of GDScript (Godot's Python-like scripting language)

Docker (optional, for containerized AI services)

Setting Up the LLM Backend

Option 1: Local Ollama Setup

Install Ollama and download a model like Llama 3 or Gemma using ollama pull llama3. Start the Ollama server with ollama serve, which runs on localhost:11434 by default. This approach keeps data private and eliminates API costs.reddityoutube

Option 2: Cloud API Integration

Configure API keys for services like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google Gemini. The Godot LLM Framework addon supports multiple providers with a unified interface.github+1

Creating the Godot Project

Create a new Godot project and set up the basic scene structure. Add a Control node as the root with child nodes for the user interface: a TextEdit node for input, a RichTextLabel for displaying responses, and a Button for sending messages. Configure the layout to fill the screen using the Layout menu with "Fill" and "Expand" options.youtubealgorythmacademy

Building the HTTP Connection

Since Godot's native HTTPRequest node waits for complete responses rather than streaming tokens, create a custom API access script. Download pre-built scripts like the API access files from community repositories, or implement a custom HTTP client using GDScript's StreamPeerTCP for streaming responses.githubyoutube

Add an APIAccess node to the scene and configure the hostname (localhost for local Ollama) and port (11434 for Ollama). Connect to the host on scene load using the _ready() function with api_access.connect_to_host().youtube

Implementing Message Sending

Create a message dictionary containing the model name and prompt. For a simple completion request to Ollama's /api/generate endpoint, structure the dictionary as:youtube

text
var message_dict = {
    "model": "llama3",
    "prompt": user_message
}


Send the POST request using api_access.send_post_request(message_dict, "/api/generate").youtube

Handling Streaming Responses

Connect to the chunk_received signal from the API access node to receive streaming tokens. Parse the JSON-formatted chunk and extract the response field:youtube

text
func _on_chunk_received(chunk: String):
    var chunk_dict = JSON.parse_string(chunk)
    response_label.text += chunk_dict["response"]


This displays the AI's response word-by-word as it generates.youtube

Adding Context and Memory

For chat-based simulations with conversation memory, use Ollama's /api/chat endpoint instead. Maintain a message history array containing previous user and assistant messages with their roles. When sending a new message, include the conversation history up to a character limit to avoid exceeding the model's context window.youtube

Iterate backwards through message history, appending each entry with its role (user or assistant) until reaching the token limit.youtube

Implementing Prompt Engineering

For character-driven simulations or NPC dialogue, construct detailed prompts that include:godotengineyoutube

Scenario description and background context

Character personality traits and speaking style

Previous conversation history

Specific instructions for response format

Current situation or user input

The prompt structure guides the LLM to generate contextually appropriate responses matching the simulation's narrative.youtube

Using Plugins and Frameworks

The Godot LLM Framework addon provides a unified interface for multiple AI providers with features like message history management, tool systems for custom functions, and asynchronous operations. The GodotAgent plugin uses Eidolon AI SDK for agent-based interactions with configurable behaviors defined in YAML files.godotengine+1

Advanced Simulation Features

For complex simulations, implement finite state machines for NPC behavior alongside LLM responses, combine Godot's pathfinding system with AI decision-making, or create dynamic content generation for quests and dialogue trees. NPC agents can be configured with system prompts that define their personalities and knowledge domains.algorythmacademy+2

Testing and Optimization

Test the simulation by verifying the connection status, monitoring response latency, and adjusting prompt complexity to balance response quality with generation speed. Enable or disable the send button based on connection status using the connection_success signal.youtube
