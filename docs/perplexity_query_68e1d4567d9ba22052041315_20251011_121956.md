**query:**

using AI/LLMs, Possibly using a game engine?

**answer:** Integrating AI/LLMs into game development is increasingly accessible through modern game engines and specialized libraries, offering capabilities ranging from dynamic NPC conversations to procedural content generation. Game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine provide robust frameworks for LLM integration, while Rust developers have access to powerful libraries for building AI-powered games.gamengen+2

Game Engine Integration
Unity with LLMs

Unity supports LLM integration through the LLMUnity package, an open-source toolkit that allows developers to run language models locally within the Unity engine. The package enables cross-platform deployment across Windows, Linux, and macOS, runs entirely offline, and supports both CPU and GPU acceleration. Integration requires minimal codeâ€”developers can set up conversational NPCs with just a few lines using the Chat function. This approach enables intelligent NPC interactions that go beyond traditional multiple-choice dialogue systems, creating more immersive player experiences.towardsdatascience+2

Unity also offers the ML-Agents Toolkit for training intelligent agents using reinforcement learning and neural networks, allowing NPCs to learn from player behavior in real-time.gamengen

Unreal Engine AI Systems

Unreal Engine provides native AI capabilities through Behavior Trees and AI Perception Systems that enable NPCs to react dynamically to stimuli like sound, sight, and player actions. Developers have successfully integrated open-source LLMs locally within Unreal Engine 5.6, combining the engine's high-fidelity graphics with adaptive AI systems.unrealengine+1

Other Engine Options

Godot Engine with GDQuest AI Tools offers a lightweight, open-source alternative particularly suited for indie developers, providing pathfinding, decision-making AI, and procedural generation capabilities. CryEngine delivers advanced AI navigation meshes and dynamic environmental interaction for complex open-world settings.gamengen

Rust-Specific Solutions

For Rust developers, several libraries facilitate LLM integration:

llm crate (version 1.2.4+) provides a unified API for multiple LLM backends including OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, Google Gemini, and others. The library offers multi-backend support, function calling, memory management for conversation history, and can even serve LLM backends as REST APIs with OpenAI-standard formatting. This aligns well with existing FiveM development work using Ollama for dynamic content generation.reddit+1

Bevy is Rust's most popular game engine (26k+ GitHub stars) with a data-driven ECS architecture suitable for 3D game development. wgpu provides cross-platform 3D graphics implementing WebGPU, while ggez and macroquad offer simpler 2D game engine options.webgamedev

Local LLM Integration with Ollama

Given existing experience with Ollama in FiveM projects, Ollama integration extends naturally to game development environments. Ollama supports 40+ LLM models locally with GPU acceleration, memory-mapped model loading, and REST API access. Popular models like Mistral (4.1GB) and Llama2 (3.8GB) run efficiently with 8GB RAM, achieving speeds around 28-35 tokens per second.collabnix+1

The Rust llm crate includes direct Ollama integration examples, enabling local model inference without external API dependencies. This approach provides privacy-preserving AI that runs entirely on local hardware while maintaining low latency for real-time game interactions.github+2

Practical Applications

LLMs enable several game development innovations:

Dynamic NPC Dialogue: Moving beyond pre-scripted conversations to allow players to interact naturally with game characters using free-form text input. The Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor Nemesis System demonstrates how AI-driven NPCs can remember player interactions and evolve based on past encounters.arsturn+2

Procedural Content Generation: Automating creation of levels, terrains, characters, and game worlds, as demonstrated by No Man's Sky's billion-planet universe.gamengen

Instruction-Driven Game Engines: Research projects explore using LLMs to generate gameplay processes through natural language instructions, enabling rapid game prototyping with minimal coding.arxiv+1

Adaptive Gameplay: Real-time difficulty adjustment and personalized experiences based on player behavior analysis.meegle+1

Development Recommendations

Start with Unity and LLMUnity for the most straightforward integration path with extensive documentation and community support. For Rust-native development, the llm crate with Ollama backend provides a powerful, flexible solution that integrates with existing Rust toolchains and supports the Ollama setup already used in FiveM projects.github+3

Consider beginning with simple implementations like conversational NPCs before expanding to more complex systems like procedural generation or adaptive AI opponents. The combination of game engines' visual tools with LLM capabilities creates opportunities for innovative gameplay mechanics that weren't feasible with traditional scripting approaches.developers.googleblog+3
