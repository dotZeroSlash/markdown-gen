## ðŸ¤– Query

How do I exit vim?

---

## ðŸ’¬ Response

To exit Vim, first press **Esc** to ensure you are in normal mode, then use one of these commands:

- `:wq` â€” save changes and quit Vim.
- `:q` â€” quit Vim if no changes were made.
- `:q!` â€” quit Vim discarding any unsaved changes.

Type the command after pressing colon `:` and then press Enter to execute it[1][3][4].

Additional important details:
- Pressing **Esc** returns you from insert or visual mode to normal mode, which is required before typing commands like `:wq` or `:q`[1][5].
- `:wq` writes (saves) your file to disk and quits.
- `:q` fails with an error if the file has unsaved changes; in that case, use `:q!` to force quit without saving[1][4].
- An alternative shortcut to save and quit is pressing **Shift+Z** twice (`ZZ`) in normal mode[2].

These steps allow quick exiting whether you want to save or abandon your edits.
