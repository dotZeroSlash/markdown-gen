## ðŸ“Š Analyst Recommendation

**Recommended Symbols:** LAC, BURU, DFLI, ASNS, PLUG, ICR, IQV, JNJ, AAPL, COST, AVGO, WMT

### Analysis Summary
Based on recent technical analysis for October 2025, several symbols show promising setups for the next trading session. **LAC, BURU, DFLI, ASNS, and PLUG** are specifically highlighted as top picks for October 6, 2025.

**ICR (Icon PLC)** in the healthcare providers sector shows strong momentum with a breakout above a triple top pattern, supported by increasing relative strength and volume, targeting the recent high at $210. **IQV**, another healthcare provider, has also completed its breakout pattern.

From the broader October watchlist, **JNJ** and **AAPL** remain on focus charts for technical setups. **COST (Costco)** and **AVGO (Broadcom)** show continued strength in their respective sectors, while **WMT (Walmart)** presents defensive positioning opportunities.

The healthcare sector appears particularly active with both ICR and IQV showing breakout patterns with strong relative strength indicators. The combination of volume confirmation and technical pattern completions suggests these names could see continued momentum into the next session. Consider monitoring pre-market action and opening price levels relative to recent breakout points when evaluating entry opportunities.
