**query:** What is FiveM?

**response:**

**FiveM** is a multiplayer modification framework for Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) that allows players to create and join custom, dedicated multiplayer servers independent from Rockstar Games' official GTA Online. It supports extensive customization through custom scripts, mods, and game modes, such as roleplay (RP), racing, and zombie survival, enabling players to experience a wide range of gameplay styles beyond those available in GTA Online[1][2][3][4].

Key features of FiveM include:

- **Custom Servers:** Players can host or join servers with unique rules, mods, and gameplay styles, providing a personalized multiplayer experience.
- **Roleplay Focus:** Many servers emphasize immersive role-playing scenarios where players create characters and interact in structured environments.
- **Mod Support:** Extensive support for custom vehicles, maps, scripts, and game modifications.
- **Community-Driven:** The servers and content are created and managed by the community, fostering creativity and ownership.
- **No Official Rockstar Support:** FiveM operates independently without official support from Rockstar Games.
- **No Microtransactions:** Most FiveM servers do not have microtransactions, though donations for server maintenance are common.
- **Native Function Access:** FiveM uses "native functions" from GTA V's game code to manipulate gameplay and add features[1][6][7].

Since its release on May 31, 2015, FiveM has grown significantly in popularity, even surpassing GTA V's base game concurrent player counts at times[2]. It has also created a vibrant ecosystem with implications for game development and decentralized, community-driven monetization models[5].

In summary, FiveM is a popular, community-centered platform that allows GTA V players to enjoy custom multiplayer experiences beyond the official online modes, with a strong focus on roleplay and modding capabilities.
