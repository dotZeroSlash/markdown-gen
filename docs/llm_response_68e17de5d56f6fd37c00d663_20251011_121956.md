## ðŸ¤– Query

What alternatives to Github are there?

---

## ðŸ’¬ Response

There are several notable alternatives to GitHub, each offering different features for code hosting, collaboration, and DevOps workflows. Key alternatives include:

- **GitLab**: A popular all-in-one DevOps platform with integrated CI/CD, built-in container registry, issue tracking, and free private repositories. It can be self-hosted and is favored by enterprises and DevOps teams for its comprehensive features[1][2][3][4].

- **Bitbucket**: Provides Git and Mercurial repository hosting with strong Jira integration, code review tools, and cloud-based collaboration[2][6].

- **SourceForge**: An older but still active platform focusing on open source project hosting, with tools for releases and downloads[1][2].

- **Gitea**: A lightweight, self-hosted Git service that is fast and easy to deploy, suitable for individuals or small teams wanting control over their hosting[1][2][4].

- **Codeberg**: A free hosted Git service powered by Gitea that offers a similar user experience without the need for self-hosting[1].

- **RhodeCode**: An enterprise-focused code management platform offering centralized control across repositories with community and premium versions[1].

- **AWS CodeCommit** and **Google Cloud Source Repositories**: Cloud-hosted source control services integrated with AWS and Google Cloud respectively, suitable for teams already working within those clouds[1][2][6].

- **Azure DevOps**: Microsoft's suite that provides Git repositories along with extensive DevOps tools, including CI/CD and project management[2][4].

- **GitKraken**: A Git client with repository hosting features targeted mainly at improving Git workflows, with integrated issue tracking and code review[2][4].

Other lesser-known but useful alternatives include **Apache Allura**, **ONEDEV**, **Bitrise**, and **Harness**, which focus on specific aspects like automation and CI/CD[1].

In summary, the best alternative depends on your needs: for a fully integrated DevOps platform, GitLab is most comparable; for lightweight and self-hosted options, Gitea; and for cloud integration, AWS CodeCommit or Azure DevOps are strong choices[1][2][4].
