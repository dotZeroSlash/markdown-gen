**query:**

How do I get a free Grok Code Fast 1 Api Key?

**answer:** You can currently get free access to the Grok Code Fast 1 API through several official and partner platforms, including GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Cline, Roo, and others, without needing a paid API key during the extended free trial period. For direct API key generation, follow the process on the xAI PromptIDE platform: log in with your X (formerly Twitter) account, navigate to the API Keys section, and create a new key to use with your own SDK or REST client.apidog+4youtube

Steps for Free Access

Enable Grok Code Fast 1 in supported platforms like GitHub Copilot or Cursor, where it is available for free for a limited time—no API key is needed for most integrations during the promo.youtubecursor+1

If you want direct API access, sign up or log in at the xAI platform, then generate an API key in PromptIDE following the steps: Profile → API Keys → Create API Key → Configure permissions → Save and copy the key.merge+2

Set up your development environment with Python and the xAI SDK, or use OpenRouter for REST-based access with its own key (compatible with OpenAI clients).x+2

Free Access Period

The current complimentary access for Grok Code Fast 1 has been extended and will remain available until further notice (as of late September 2025).cursor

After the trial period ends, normal usage costs will apply ($0.2 per million input tokens, $1.5 per million output tokens).apidog+1

Tips

For integrations in IDEs, activating Grok Code Fast 1 may just require updating the app or extension, as many platforms have automated the free access during the promotional period.github+1youtube

If using direct API, securely store your generated API key in an environment variable (e.g., XAI_API_KEY), always follow security practices, and consult xAI documentation for advanced settings.merge+1

Free usage is subject to rate limits and platform policies, but it is designed to be as frictionless as possible for new developers.x+2
