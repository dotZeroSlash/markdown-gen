# What would the minimum be for this

To create a minimum viable Old School RuneScape (OSRS) clone, you would need to implement these core systems:

## Core Engine and Architecture

- **Basic client-server structure**: A simple server implementation in Java or another suitable language with a corresponding client
- **Simplified world**: A grid-based world divided into small regions that load as players move through them
- **Tick system**: A basic tick-based system (0.6 seconds per tick in original OSRS) to handle game state updates


## Character System

- **Basic character creation**: Allow players to create and customize a simple avatar
- **Core skills only**: Implement 5-7 essential skills instead of all 20+ from OSRS
    - Combat (Attack, Strength, Defense)
    - 2-3 gathering skills (Mining, Fishing, or Woodcutting)
    - 1-2 processing skills (Cooking or Smithing)
- **Simplified progression**: Basic experience system with levels that unlock new content


## Combat Mechanics

- **Simple combat calculations**: Basic formulas for hit chance and damage based on stats and equipment
- **Combat styles**: Implement melee combat with 1-2 weapon types
- **Monster AI**: Simple enemy behavior patterns with basic pathfinding


## Item System

- **Limited item database**: Create 100-200 essential items instead of thousands
- **Basic inventory**: Player inventory with standard capacity limits
- **Simple equipment system**: Core equipment slots (weapon, armor, etc.)


## World Interaction

- **Resource gathering**: Implement a few resource nodes (trees, ore) with simple harvesting mechanics
- **Basic banking**: Allow players to store items at designated bank locations
- **NPC interaction**: Simple dialogue system for essential game functions


## Technical Requirements

- **Networking**: Basic client-server communication with minimal security for multiplayer functionality
- **Pathfinding**: Simple A* pathfinding for player movement and NPC navigation
- **Saving system**: Basic character state persistence to database


## Content Minimum

- **Starting area**: One complete town/region with necessary facilities (bank, shops, training areas)
- **Monsters**: 10-15 different enemy types with varying difficulty
- **Quests**: 3-5 simple quests to demonstrate the quest framework

This minimal implementation would capture the essence of OSRS while significantly reducing development scope. As noted in the search results, OSRS is often described as "lightning in a bottle" - even with these minimum systems, ensuring they interact cohesively is crucial for recreating the distinctive OSRS feel.
