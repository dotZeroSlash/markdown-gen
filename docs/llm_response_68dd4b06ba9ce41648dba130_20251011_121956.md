**response:**

<think>
The user is asking for stock symbols to look at on the next opening day based on previous stock data. I need to analyze the search results to find specific stock recommendations with their symbols.

Looking at the search results:

From search result [1] (YouTube video from Sept 27, 2025):
- Robinhood stock (HOOD) - has major catalysts including banking and PDT rule removal
- Qualigen Therapeutics (QLGN) - crypto space player with C10 crypto treasury  
- Nvidia (NVDA) - AI chip space powerhouse, getting into AI datacenters
- Opendoor (OPEN) - about to turn profitable, will benefit from lower fed rates
- Tesla (TSLA) - has catalysts like Robotaxi and Optimus Bot

From search result [3] (YouTube video from Sept 25, 2025):
- Mentions Palantir and Nvidia again
- Microsoft and Google mentioned as mega-caps

From search result [5] (YouTube video about October stocks):
- Vistra Corp (VST) - utility sector, AI theme, up 82% over past 12 months, up nearly 40% this year

The user wants me to structure the output with symbols first, then explanation. The current date is October 1, 2025, so these recommendations are very recent and relevant for the "next opening day" which would be the next trading day.

I should format this according to their requested structure:
symbols: [symbol values]
output: explanation
</think>

symbols: [HOOD, QLGN, NVDA, OPEN, TSLA, VST]

output: Based on recent analysis from late September 2025, these six symbols present compelling opportunities for the next trading session. **Robinhood (HOOD)** stands out with multiple catalysts including their upcoming banking services and the removal of the pattern day trading rule[1]. **Qualigen Therapeutics (QLGN)** offers exposure to the crypto space through their new C10 crypto treasury and crypto index[1].

**Nvidia (NVDA)** remains a powerhouse in the AI chip sector and is expanding into AI datacenters, making it attractive as AI spending continues to grow[1]. **Opendoor (OPEN)** is positioned to benefit significantly from anticipated lower federal interest rates, with the company approaching profitability[1]. **Tesla (TSLA)** has substantial catalysts on the horizon including their Robotaxi program and Optimus Bot development[1].

**Vistra Corp (VST)** represents an interesting play in the utility sector with strong AI infrastructure exposure, having gained 82% over the past 12 months and nearly 40% year-to-date as of late September 2025[5]. The company benefits from the increasing power demands of new data centers and AI infrastructure buildouts.

These recommendations focus on companies with immediate catalysts, strong positioning in growth sectors like AI and crypto, and those that should benefit from changing monetary policy conditions. The timing appears favorable given the recent momentum and upcoming developments for each of these positions.
