**response:**

<think>
The user is asking for stock symbols to look at for the next opening day, and they want me to structure the output in a specific format with symbols and explanation. 

Looking at the search results, I can see several YouTube videos discussing stocks to buy before October 2025. Since the current date is October 1, 2025, these videos are quite relevant as they were made in late September 2025 (just before October).

From the search results, I can identify several stock symbols mentioned:

From search result [1] (Sep 27, 2025):
- HOOD (Robinhood stock) - mentioned as having major catalysts including upcoming banking and PDT rule removal
- QLGN (Qualigen Therapeutics) - mentioned as a crypto space player with C10 crypto treasury
- NVDA (Nvidia) - AI chip powerhouse getting into AI datacenters
- OPEN (Opendoor) - about to turn profitable, will benefit from lower fed interest rates
- TSLA (Tesla) - has catalysts including Robotaxi and Optimus Bot

From search result [3]:
- OPEN is mentioned again with technical analysis suggesting it could go to $20-25
- BMNR (Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc.) - crypto-focused company with Tom Lee as chairman, pivoted to Ethereum accumulation

From search result [5] (Sep 25, 2025):
- This mentions "8 BEST Stocks" and references PLTR (Palantir), NVDA (Nvidia), MSFT (Microsoft), and GOOGL (Google) as potential winners

I should structure this according to the user's requested format.

symbols: [HOOD, NVDA, TSLA, OPEN, QLGN, BMNR, MSFT, GOOGL, PLTR]

output: Based on recent analysis from late September 2025, several stocks show strong potential catalysts heading into October. **Robinhood (HOOD)** appears particularly compelling with upcoming banking services and the removal of pattern day trading rules that could drive significant price movement[1]. **Nvidia (NVDA)** continues to dominate the AI chip space while expanding into AI datacenters, making it a consistent pick across multiple analyses[1][5].

**Tesla (TSLA)** has major catalysts on the horizon including their Robotaxi technology and Optimus Bot developments[1]. **Opendoor (OPEN)** is positioned to benefit from lower federal interest rates and is approaching profitability, with technical analysis suggesting potential upside to $20-25[1][3]. 

**Qualigen Therapeutics (QLGN)** offers exposure to the crypto space through their C10 crypto treasury and index strategy[1]. **Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR)** is another crypto-focused play, led by Wall Street veteran Tom Lee and pivoting toward Ethereum accumulation[3].

The mega-cap opportunities include **Microsoft (MSFT)** and **Google (GOOGL)**, which analysts expect to outperform as the Fed begins cutting rates[5]. **Palantir (PLTR)** is also mentioned as having breakout potential similar to previous explosive moves[5].

These picks represent a mix of AI exposure, crypto plays, interest rate beneficiaries, and established tech giants positioned for the current market environment as October 2025 begins.
