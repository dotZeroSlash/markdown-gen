What are rust traits?

**answer:** Traits are a fundamental feature in Rust that define shared behavior across different types, functioning similarly to interfaces in languages like Java or type classes in Haskell.doc.rust-lang+1

Core Concept

A trait specifies a collection of method signatures that types can implement, telling the compiler what functionality a particular type provides and can share with others. Traits define behavior abstractly without specifying the concrete type—using Self to represent whichever type will implement the trait.doc.rust-lang+2

Defining and Implementing Traits

Traits are defined using the trait keyword followed by method signatures. For example:geeksforgeeks

rust
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String;
}


To implement a trait for a type, all methods specified in the trait must be defined in a single implementation block:reddit+1

rust
pub struct NewsArticle {
    pub headline: String,
    pub author: String,
}

impl Summary for NewsArticle {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("{}, by {}", self.headline, self.author)
    }
}

Key Features

Traits support default implementations, allowing types to use predefined behavior or override it as needed. They can be used as function parameters with the impl Trait syntax, enabling functions to accept any type that implements a specific trait. Traits can also specify return types, allowing functions to return any type implementing the trait without exposing the concrete type.dev+1

Why Traits Matter

Traits enable polymorphism and code reuse throughout Rust. Many core language features rely on traits—for example, for loops work through the IntoIterator trait, and formatting with println! requires the Display trait. Unlike traditional interfaces, traits focus exclusively on defining what an instance can do rather than what properties it has, emphasizing behavior over structure.serokell+2
