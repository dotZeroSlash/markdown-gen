**query:**

What types of problems are best solved using different neural network architectures like CNNs RNNs and autoencoders?

**answer:** Different neural network architectures are best suited for different types of problems based on the nature and structure of the input data they process:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):

Best for problems involving grid-like topology data such as images and videos.

Excellent at capturing spatial hierarchies and patterns, such as edges, textures, and shapes.

Common applications include image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

CNNs leverage convolutional layers that scan over local regions to learn features invariant to translation.geeksforgeeks+1

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):

Ideal for sequential and time-series data where the order and temporal dependencies matter.

Capable of processing variable-length sequences such as language, audio, and sensor data.

Extensively used in natural language processing (e.g., language modeling, translation), speech recognition, and sequential prediction problems.

LSTM and GRU variants address training challenges like vanishing gradients to capture long-term dependencies.eitca+1

Autoencoders:

Best suited for unsupervised tasks like data compression, dimensionality reduction, and feature learning.

Used for reconstructing inputs, learning latent representations, denoising data, and anomaly detection.

Can learn nonlinear manifold representations that generalize better than linear methods like PCA.

Variants include undercomplete autoencoders for compression and contractive autoencoders for robust feature extraction.v7labs+1

In summary, use CNNs for spatial pattern recognition in images, RNNs for sequence modeling and temporal data, and autoencoders for learning efficient data representations, denoising, or anomaly detection tasks.geeksforgeeks+2
