# AI Talk Show Gameplan

## Overview
Create a TypeScript-based simulation of a talk show with two customizable AI personalities that react to topics in character.

## Architecture & Tech Stack
- **Core**: TypeScript/Node.js for backend logic
- **Libraries**: `readline` for CLI, `fs` for config, possibly `openai` or similar for AI responses if integrating LLMs
- **Structure**: Separate files for classes (e.g., `ai.ts`, `topic.ts`), main entry `index.ts`

## Detailed Implementation

### 1. Define AI Personalities
- Create TypeScript classes for each AI (e.g., `HostAI` and `GuestAI`)
- Properties: `name`, `personalityTraits` (array of strings like "witty", "serious")
- Methods: `react(topic: Topic)` to generate responses based on personality
- Expansion: Include reaction templates (e.g., "witty": ["That's hilarious!", "Let's joke about it..."]), scoring system for topic relevance

### 2. Topic Handling
- Implement a `Topic` class with `title` and `description`
- AI reactions vary by traits (e.g., witty adds humor, serious provides analysis)
- Expansion: Add categories (e.g., politics, tech), user input validation, dynamic topic generation

### 3. Conversation Simulation
- Main loop in `index.ts` to alternate turns
- Host introduces topic, Guest reacts, Host responds, etc.
- Use random or scripted elements for natural flow
- Expansion: Implement turn-based logic with timers, interrupt handling, conversation history storage

### 4. Personalization
- Config file (e.g., `config.json`) for user-set traits
- Load at startup to customize AI behaviors
- Expansion: JSON schema for config, UI for editing traits in CLI

### 5. Output and Interaction
- Compile to JS and run via Node.js
- CLI prompts for topics/personalities using `readline`
- Optional: Expand to web interface later

### 6. Testing and Iteration
- Start with simple reactions and sample topics
- Refine for coherence; use TypeScript for type safety

## Features & User Stories
- As a user, I want to set AI names and traits via config
- As a user, I want real-time conversation output
- As a user, I want to save/load conversation logs
- Bonus: Voice synthesis, web UI with React

## Dependencies & Setup
- List npm packages: `typescript`, `readline`, `@types/node`
- Installation steps, build commands (`npm run build`, `npm run watch`)

## Challenges & Solutions
- Natural language generation: Use predefined responses initially, upgrade to AI APIs later
- Personality consistency: Implement stateful memory for past reactions
- Performance: Optimize for CLI, avoid heavy computations

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for classes (Jest), integration tests for full simulation
- Sample topics: "Climate Change", "AI Ethics" with expected reactions

## Milestones & Timeline
- Week 1: Basic classes and CLI
- Week 2: Conversation logic and personalization
- Week 3: Testing, refinements, and optional features

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-AI support, topic voting, integration with external APIs for dynamic content
