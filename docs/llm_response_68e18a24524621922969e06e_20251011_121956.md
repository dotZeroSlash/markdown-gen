## ü§ñ Query

Gemini offers a great free LLM api, are there any other free apis available?

---

## üí¨ Response

Besides Gemini‚Äôs free LLM API, there are several notable **free large language model (LLM) APIs** available in 2025, offering either no-cost tiers, free credits, or open-source access for developers:

- **Mistral AI API**: Offers a free tier with meaningful token limits, including ‚ÄúCodestral,‚Äù a model specialized in code generation, which reportedly has very generous or near-unlimited free usage, making it excellent for coding-related applications[2][5].

- **Google AI Studio**: Provides access to Gemini 2.0 and Gemini 2.5 Flash models with free tiers allowing reasonable rate limits suitable for prototyping and moderate usage[3][4].

- **Hugging Face Inference API**: Hosts thousands of open-source models available via a free tier (usually with some usage caps and no SLA), great for experimenting with diverse models[3][5].

- **OpenRouter**: Aggregates various popular LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini, Llama 3) with limited free credits for testing and comparing models in one place[3][5].

- **Cloudflare Workers AI**: Provides access to several open models like OpenChat 3.5, Starling LM 7B Beta, SQLCoder 7B, and other fine-tuned or experimental models for free[1][5].

- **Other providers with free or trial offerings**: NVIDIA NIM, Vercel AI Gateway, Cerebras, Groq, Cohere, Together, Google Cloud Vertex AI, and others listed on GitHub resource repositories offer various free access or credit-based models[5].

Many platforms provide **free API access tiers** that come with usage limits or token caps but allow developers to experiment and build POCs without upfront costs. The landscape is rich with open-source and commercial models accessible for free in varying capacities.

This ecosystem means that for developers seeking free LLM APIs beyond Gemini‚Äôs offering, there is a vibrant and growing set of alternatives catering to general, specialized (e.g., code generation), and multimodal AI needs[1][2][3][5].
