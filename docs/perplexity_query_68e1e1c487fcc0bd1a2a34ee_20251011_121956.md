**query:**

What role do weights and biases play in the learning process of neural networks?

**answer:** Weights and biases are fundamental parameters in the learning process of neural networks.

Weights determine the strength of the connections between neurons in different layers. They scale the input signals, deciding how much influence each input feature has on the neuron's output. During training, weights are iteratively adjusted to minimize the difference between the network's predicted output and the actual target, allowing the network to learn complex patterns in data and make accurate predictions.

Biases are additional parameters added to the weighted sum of inputs before applying an activation function. Unlike weights, biases are not tied to any input and allow the neural network to shift the activation function, giving the network flexibility to model data patterns that do not necessarily pass through the origin. Biases help neurons activate even when inputs are minimal or zero, enhancing the network's ability to fit data effectively.

Together, weights and biases are adjusted throughout training (e.g., via gradient descent and backpropagation) to optimize the neural network's performance, enabling it to generalize well on new, unseen data.

In summary:

Weights control the importance of each input feature in influencing the output.

Biases allow shifting the activation function to improve model flexibility.

Both are learned parameters essential for minimizing prediction errors and capturing complex data patterns.

This joint adjustment is what enables neural networks to "learn" from data and improve their predictive capabilities over time.geeksforgeeks+2
