**query:** Who is the most famous streamer on twitch.tv?

**response:**

That's a tricky question because **"most famous" can be measured in several ways** (highest concurrent viewers, most followers, cultural impact, or consistency of viewership).

However, as of late 2023 and early 2024, the streamer who is most consistently cited as the **most famous or largest on Twitch by follower count and massive global recognition** is generally considered to be:

## **Ninja (Tyler Blevins)**

**Why Ninja is often considered the most famous:**

1. **Massive Peak Popularity:** He became a global phenomenon during the peak of *Fortnite*'s popularity (around 2018), achieving viewership numbers that were unprecedented on the platform.
2. **Record Follower Count:** For a very long time, he held the record for the most followers on Twitch, although this position is often contested or overtaken by others who focus purely on follower accumulation.
3. **Mainstream Crossover:** He has crossed over into traditional media, collaborated with major brands (Adidas, Red Bull), and appeared on shows like *The Masked Singer*.

### **Other Contenders for "Most Famous" Right Now (Current Viewership & Cultural Impact):**

While Ninja remains the recognizable name globally, if you are talking about who has the **largest active audience or highest concurrent viewers *right now***, the answer often shifts to:

*   **Kai Cenat:** Currently one of the biggest stars on the platform, known for his high-energy personality, collaborations, and massive sub goals that have broken records. He often dominates the platform in terms of active engagement and viewership.
*   **Shroud (Michael Grzesiek):** Known for his incredible skill in FPS games, he maintains a massive, dedicated audience and is one of the most recognized names in gaming.
*   **Ibai (Ibai Llanos):** While he primarily speaks Spanish, he is arguably the biggest streamer in the world by cultural impact and viewership within the Spanish-speaking world, hosting massive non-gaming events.

**In summary:**

*   **Global recognition/Historical Fame:** **Ninja**
*   **Current Dominance/Viewership:** **Kai Cenat**
