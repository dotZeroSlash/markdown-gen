How do I create a Go Project?

**answer:** To create a Go project, follow these key steps:

Create a new directory for your project.

Initialize a Go module in that directory with the command go mod init <module-name>. The module name is usually the repository path or any unique name you want.

Create your Go source files in the directory. For executable programs, start your main file with package main and implement a main() function.

Write your Go code (e.g., a simple "Hello, world" program).

Use go run . to run the program or go build to compile it into an executable binary.

Manage dependencies automatically with your go.mod file as you add imports.

For example:

bash
mkdir hello
cd hello
go mod init example.com/hello


Then create a file main.go:

go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, world")
}


Run the program with:

bash
go run .


Or build it with:

bash
go build
./hello


This process is the standard starter for Go projects and supports dependency tracking and builds out of the box.go+5
