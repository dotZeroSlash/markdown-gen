**query:** What is t3.gg?

**response:**

**t3.gg** is the official website and primary resource for the **T3 Stack**.

The **T3 Stack** is a popular, opinionated, full-stack web development boilerplate/starter kit that aims to provide a great developer experience, emphasizing type-safety across the entire stack.

It typically consists of the following core technologies:

*   **Next.js:** For the React frontend and API routes.
*   **tRPC:** For type-safe end-to-end APIs between your frontend and backend.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** For utility-first styling.
*   **Prisma:** For database ORM (Object-Relational Mapper).
*   **TypeScript:** Which underpins all these technologies for enhanced type safety and developer experience.

The t3.gg website provides:
*   **Documentation:** Explaining each component and how they work together.
*   **Guides:** For getting started and building common features.
*   **`create-t3-app`:** The command-line tool used to quickly scaffold a new project with the T3 Stack.
*   **Community resources:** Links to Discord, GitHub, etc.

In essence, if you hear about the "T3 Stack" or "create-t3-app," t3.gg is where you'd go to learn more and get started.
