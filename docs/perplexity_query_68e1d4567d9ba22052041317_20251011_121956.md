What are the best AI/LLM models for creating 3D models?

**answer:** The best AI and LLM models for creating 3D models combine specialized 3D generation platforms with language models adapted for spatial understanding. These tools range from fast consumer-friendly generators to advanced research models that integrate text understanding with 3D mesh generation.reddit+4

Dedicated 3D Generation Platforms

Meshy AI stands out as one of the most popular platforms for generating game-ready 3D assets from text prompts or images. It offers fast generation speeds and supports multiple export formats suitable for game engines and 3D printing workflows.travisvermilye+2

Tripo AI leverages a multi-billion parameter foundation model that generates high-quality textured meshes in as little as 8 seconds, with optional 2-minute refinement for near-human quality results. It supports formats like STL, GLB, and FBX, making it versatile for gaming, 3D printing, and XR applications.kingroon+1

3D AI Studio provides rapid model generation with strong integration capabilities for tools like Blender and Unity. It excels at converting text and images into detailed 3D models quickly.kingroon

Sloyd AI offers both generative AI capabilities and customizable parametric templates that produce game-ready models with optimized topology in seconds. This hybrid approach provides creators with more control over the output while maintaining speed.sloyd

LLM-Based 3D Models

LLaMA-Mesh by NVIDIA represents a breakthrough in unifying language models with 3D generation. This model extends LLaMA 3.1-8B-Instruct to understand and generate 3D mesh data by tokenizing vertex coordinates and face definitions as plain text. LLaMA-Mesh can generate meshes from text descriptions, interpret existing 3D structures, and even produce interleaved text and 3D outputs. A Blender add-on called MeshGen makes it accessible for local use.bioerrorlog+4

Point-E by OpenAI generates 3D point clouds from text prompts or images in 1-2 minutes on a single GPU. While it doesn't match state-of-the-art quality, it prioritizes efficiency and accessibility, making 3D generation more available to consumers.wandb+3

Diffusion-Based Models

Stable Fast 3D by Stability AI transforms single images into detailed 3D assets in just 0.5 seconds. Built on TripoSR foundations, it features architectural improvements that deliver UV unwrapped meshes suitable for game development and VR applications.stability

SV3D (Stable Video 3D) adapts image-to-video diffusion models for novel multi-view synthesis and 3D generation. It generates orbital videos around 3D objects with explicit camera control, achieving state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction.sv3d.github+1

Image-Based AI Tools

CSM AI focuses on transforming images, text, and sketches into game-ready 3D assets and worlds. It's trusted by leading game studios for rapid prototyping and asset creation.csm

Alpha3D specializes in converting 2D images into 3D assets at scale with fast turnaround times. It excels at high-volume generation for enterprise use cases, supporting formats like GLB and OBJ.kingroon
