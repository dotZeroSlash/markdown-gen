**query:** What is 2+2?

**response:**

**The sum of 2 + 2 is 4.**

This is a straightforward arithmetic addition where adding two and two results in four, as confirmed by multiple reliable sources[1][5].

Additional context: While 2 + 2 equals 4 in basic arithmetic with the standard definition of addition on integers, the interpretation can vary depending on the context or how addition is defined (e.g., in abstract algebra or with different units). But in conventional math and everyday use, 2 + 2 = 4 remains true and universally accepted[2].

Also, the idea that 2 + 2 might equal something else is primarily used as a literary or philosophical example to illustrate illogical reasoning, famously popularized in Orwellâ€™s *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, but it is not mathematically correct[4].
