Explain what is a blockchain

**answer:** A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that records transactions and data across a network of computers in a way that makes the information transparent, secure, and resistant to tampering. Each piece of data is stored in a "block," and these blocks are linked together in chronological order to form a "chain".investopedia+1

How It Works

Blockchain operates through a decentralized network where multiple computers (called nodes) store copies of the same data. When a new transaction occurs, it gets recorded in a block along with a timestamp and transaction data. Each block contains a cryptographic hash (a unique string of numbers and letters) of the previous block, creating an unbreakable chain of connected blocks. This structure means that altering any single block would require changing all subsequent blocks and obtaining consensus from the entire network, making unauthorized changes virtually impossible.investopedia+3

The system uses cryptographic keys—a private key and a public key—to enable secure transactions between parties. These keys create a digital signature that authenticates and authorizes transactions without requiring a trusted third party like a bank or auditor.simplilearn+1

Key Characteristics

Blockchain networks are typically decentralized, meaning no single person or organization controls the data. All participants collectively maintain control through consensus mechanisms that validate new transactions before adding them to the chain. The ledger is immutable, meaning once data is recorded, it cannot be altered retroactively. This creates a permanent, verifiable record that anyone on the network can view but no one can corrupt.blackduck+3

Applications

Originally created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 as the foundation for Bitcoin cryptocurrency, blockchain technology has expanded far beyond digital currencies. Modern applications include decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), smart contracts, and various business uses where immutable record-keeping is valuable.blockchain+2
