**response:**

<think>
The user is asking for stock symbols to look at on the next opening day based on previous days' stock data. Looking at the search results, I can see several YouTube videos about stocks to buy in October 2025. Since the current date is October 1, 2025, these recommendations are very timely.

From the search results, I can extract several stock symbols that are being recommended:

From search result [1]:
- HOOD (Robinhood stock) - mentioned with catalysts like upcoming banking and PDT rule removal
- QLGN (Qualigen Therapeutics) - crypto space player with C10 crypto treasury
- NVDA (Nvidia) - AI chip powerhouse getting into AI datacenters
- OPEN (Opendoor) - about to turn profitable, will benefit from lower fed rates
- TSLA (Tesla) - catalysts including Robotaxi and Optimus Bot

From search result [5]:
- VST (Vistra Corp) - utility sector, AI theme, up 82% over past 12 months

The user wants me to structure the output as:
symbols: [${symbol-values}]
output: {$explanation/information}

I need to follow the formatting guidelines and not mention that I'm using search results, just incorporate the information naturally.

symbols: [HOOD, QLGN, NVDA, OPEN, TSLA, VST]

output: These six symbols represent strong opportunities heading into October 2025 trading sessions, each with compelling catalysts and growth drivers.

**HOOD (Robinhood)** stands out with major upcoming catalysts including their banking services launch and the anticipated removal of the pattern day trading rule, both of which could significantly boost user engagement and revenue streams[1].

**QLGN (Qualigen Therapeutics)** presents an intriguing play in the cryptocurrency space with their new C10 crypto treasury and crypto index offerings, positioning them at the intersection of biotech and digital assets[1].

**NVDA (Nvidia)** continues to dominate the AI chip sector while expanding into AI datacenter infrastructure, maintaining its leadership position in the artificial intelligence revolution[1].

**OPEN (Opendoor Technologies)** is approaching profitability at an opportune time, as anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate cuts should provide substantial tailwinds for the real estate technology company[1].

**TSLA (Tesla)** carries multiple high-impact catalysts including their Robotaxi development and Optimus Bot rollout, representing significant potential in autonomous driving and robotics markets[1].

**VST (Vistra Corp)** offers exposure to the utility sector's AI power demand theme, with the company already delivering impressive returns of 82% over the past 12 months and nearly 40% year-to-date as data center power requirements continue expanding[5].

These selections span multiple sectors while maintaining focus on companies with specific near-term catalysts that could drive price appreciation in the current market environment.
