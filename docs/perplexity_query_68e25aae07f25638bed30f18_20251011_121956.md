What is GTARP?

**answer:** GTARP (Grand Theft Auto Roleplay) is an immersive multiplayer modification of Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V), primarily played through the FiveM platform. It allows players to join custom servers where they assume different characters, such as law enforcement, criminals, emergency responders, or civilians, and engage in realistic role-playing scenarios. This transforms GTA V into a dynamic role-playing experience focused on storytelling, immersion, and player-driven narratives rather than just traditional gameplay. Players create characters with personalities and backstories and interact with others in a living virtual world where activities include jobs, social interactions, heists, police work, and more, often following strict rules to maintain immersion.ws-rp+3
