## ðŸ¤– Query

Why is the sky blue?

---

## ðŸ’¬ Response

The sky appears blue because **blue light from the sun is scattered in all directions by the molecules and small particles in Earth's atmosphere**. This scattering, known as **Rayleigh scattering**, affects shorter wavelengths of lightâ€”such as blue and violetâ€”more than longer wavelengths like red, causing the sky to look blue during the day[1][2][3][4][5].

More specifically:

- Sunlight is made up of many colors, which together appear white.
- When sunlight passes through the atmosphere, gases like nitrogen and oxygen scatter shorter wavelength light (blue and violet) more effectively.
- Although violet light is scattered even more than blue, the sky looks blue rather than violet because our eyes are more sensitive to blue light and some violet light is absorbed by the upper atmosphere[6].
- Near the horizon, the sky appears lighter blue or white because sunlight travels through more atmosphere, scattering blue light multiple times and mixing with reflected light from Earth's surface[2][5].
- During sunrise and sunset, the light passes through even more atmosphere, scattering shorter wavelengths out of the line of sight and allowing longer wavelengths like red and orange to dominate the sky color[3].

Thus, the primary reason we see a blue sky is the **preferential scattering of short-wavelength blue light by atmospheric molecules as sunlight passes through the atmosphere**.
