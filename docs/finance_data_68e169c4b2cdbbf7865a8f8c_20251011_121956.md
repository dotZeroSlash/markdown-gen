## ðŸ“Š Analyst Recommendation

**Recommended Symbols:** AVGO, CRWD, ANET, ICR, IQV, JNJ, AAPL, COST, GILD, IBM, COIN, WMT, TTD, ETH

### Analysis Summary
**CRWD (CrowdStrike)** represents a cybersecurity leader that companies are unlikely to cut even if AI spending slows, while **ANET (Arista Networks)** benefits as a key Oracle partner from the cloud infrastructure build-out. Healthcare provider **IQV** has also made a notable breakout.

From the technical analysis watchlist, **JNJ (Johnson & Johnson)**, **AAPL (Apple)**, **COST (Costco)**, **GILD (Gilead Sciences)**, **IBM**, **COIN (Coinbase)**, and **WMT (Walmart)** all appear on the October 2025 must-watch charts list. **TTD (The Trade Desk)** is highlighted as an oversold ad-tech play with strong growth in connected TV, while **ETH (Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust)** offers exposure to stablecoin adoption and crypto trends.

These selections combine breakout strategies, moving average setups, relative strength analysis, and momentum indicators, focusing on sectors like AI/technology, healthcare, cybersecurity, and retail that show continued fundamental strength despite recent market volatility.
