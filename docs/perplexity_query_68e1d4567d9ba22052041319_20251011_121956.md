**query:**

What benefits do you get from something like godot engine instead of Love2D?

**answer:** Godot provides several significant advantages over Love2D, primarily because Godot is a full game engine while Love2D is a minimal framework.reddit+1

Visual Editor and Built-In Tools

Godot includes a complete visual editor with integrated tools for animation, tilemap editing, level design, shader editing, debugging, and profiling. Love2D lacks these features entirely, requiring developers to build or integrate third-party tools for basic functionality like scene management, cameras, and collision systems. The node-based scene system in Godot allows for easy creation of complex hierarchies and asset reuse throughout projects.news.ycombinator+3

3D Capability

Godot supports both 2D and 3D game development with separate dedicated rendering engines for each. Love2D is strictly limited to 2D games, with only basic 3D capabilities. For any project requiring 3D elements or future expansion into 3D space, Godot is the clear choice.aircada+3

Ready-to-Use Components

Godot provides out-of-the-box components including physics engines (2D and 3D), animation systems, particle systems, and scene management. Love2D requires manual implementation or third-party libraries even for fundamental features like resolution scaling and fullscreen support. This makes Godot significantly faster for prototyping and game jams where development time is limited.logiscool+3

Language Support

While Love2D uses only Lua, Godot offers multiple language options including GDScript (Python-like), C#, C++, and community bindings for Rust, Nim, and Python. Given your preference for Rust, Godot's community support for Rust bindings provides more flexibility for integrating Rust code compared to Love2D's Lua-only approach.perforce+1

Trade-offs

Love2D does offer advantages in simplicity and learning fundamentalsâ€”developers learn core programming concepts without relying on engine abstractions. It's more lightweight and gives complete control over the architecture. However, this comes at the cost of development speed and convenience for most projects.news.ycombinator+2
