**query:** What alternatives to Github are there?

**response:**

There are several notable alternatives to GitHub for Git repository hosting, CI/CD, and DevOps workflows, each with unique features and target audiences.

Key alternatives include:

- **GitLab**: A comprehensive web-based DevOps platform with integrated Git repository management, advanced CI/CD pipelines, built-in container registry, issue tracking, and project management tools. It supports both cloud-hosted and self-hosted options and is popular among enterprises seeking an all-in-one solution[2][5].

- **Bitbucket**: Provided by Atlassian, Bitbucket supports Git and Mercurial repositories with deep integration into tools like Jira. It offers cloud hosting and strong support for code review and team collaboration[2].

- **AWS CodeCommit**: A fully managed source control system from Amazon, integrated with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), suitable for teams heavily invested in AWS infrastructure[2][3][6].

- **Azure DevOps (Azure Repos)**: Microsoft's offering integrated into the Azure DevOps suite, designed for enterprises using Microsoft technologies. It provides Git hosting, pipelines, and flexible workflows[2][3][4].

- **Gitea**: A lightweight, open-source, self-hosted Git service providing an easy-to-use web interface, CI/CD, project management, and high extensibility. It's favored for small teams or organizations preferring self-hosting[2][3][4].

- **GitKraken**: A GUI-centric Git client that offers repository management and collaboration tools, with both cloud and self-hosted options[2][4].

- **SourceForge**: One of the older platforms, still hosting many open-source projects, with basic Git hosting and project management features[2].

- **Codeberg**: A nonprofit, community-run platform built on Gitea, focusing on privacy, independence from big tech, and a grassroots developer community[3].

- **Devtron**: Specializes as an alternative to GitHub Actions with built-in GitOps, Kubernetes integration, advanced deployment strategies, and a unified dashboard for cloud-native workflows[1].

Additional noteworthy tools or platforms with Git hosting capabilities include Perforce Helix Core (focused on large enterprises/complex projects), Phorge (a fork of Phabricator), Octopus Deploy, Jenkins, and Harness for specialized deployment and CI/CD functions[1][3].

In summary, the choice depends on factors like desired hosting model (cloud vs self-hosted), integrated CI/CD needs, ecosystem alignment (e.g., AWS, Microsoft), and community philosophy (commercial vs nonprofit). Among these, **GitLab** stands out as the most comprehensive GitHub alternative with strong CI/CD and DevOps features, while **Bitbucket** and **Azure Repos** are excellent for teams in their respective ecosystems, and **Gitea** and **Codeberg** suit those prioritizing lightweight or community-driven solutions[1][2][3][4].
