**query:**

What are the best AI/LLM models for creating graphical simulations?

**answer:** LLMs aren't primarily designed to create graphical simulations directly, but they excel at generating code, procedural content, and physics logic that powers simulations when integrated with game engines and physics platforms. The best approach combines code-generation-focused LLMs with specialized physics engines and procedural generation tools.arxiv+3

Top LLMs for Code Generation

Claude 4 (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) currently leads for simulation code generation, achieving 62-70% on SWE-Bench coding benchmarks. Its extended reasoning mode allows it to debug, refactor, and plan code across large projects, making it particularly effective for generating C++ or C# scripts for Unity and Unreal Engine. Claude excels at understanding complex physics requirements and translating them into working simulation code.felloai+2

Gemini 2.5 Pro offers the strongest multimodal capabilities, natively handling text, images, audio, and video inputs simultaneously. This makes it ideal for simulation projects requiring visual analysis of reference materials or scene descriptions. Gemini scores 73% on the Aider code editing benchmark and integrates well with Google's development ecosystem.unrealengine+1

GPT-4 and GPT-4.5 achieve ~54.6% on SWE-Bench and provide reliable instruction-following for generating clean, well-formatted code. While slightly behind Claude in raw generation accuracy, GPT-4 remains widely integrated across IDEs and developer tools, making it accessible for general simulation development.creatoreconomy+1

Specialized Physics AI Platforms

Genesis is an open-source physics engine specifically designed for robotics and physical AI applications. It runs at 43 million FPS for manipulation scenes (430,000x faster than real-time) and integrates a VLM-based generative agent that creates physically-accurate 4D dynamic worlds. Genesis generates articulated assets, soft-body simulations, and hybrid robot behaviors with automatic data generation capabilities.genesis-embodied-ai.github

NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo provides an open-source Python framework for building physics-AI surrogate models at scale. It combines physics-driven causality with simulation data for real-time predictions across computational fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, and electromagnetics. PhysicsNeMo supports neural operators, GNNs, and generative AI models for enterprise-scale digital twin applications.developer.nvidia

Integration Approaches

UnrealLLM demonstrates how LLMs can power procedural content generation in Unreal Engine 5 through a blueprint-style text specification system. This multi-agent execution pipeline coordinates content parsing, asset retrieval, and environment assembly with style-level control over physics simulation, pathfinding, and interactivity. LLMs generate C++ classes that can be edited directly inside Unreal Engine even though the code was generated externally.youtubelinkedin

LLM for Unity enables seamless integration of language models for creating intelligent characters and features a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system for semantic search across game data. The package runs locally without internet access and supports blazing fast inference on CPU and GPU across PC, mobile, and VR platforms.github+1

For your Rust-focused workflow, Claude 4 offers the best combination of code generation accuracy and reasoning capabilities for simulation logic, while Genesis provides an open-source physics platform that could integrate with Rust through its API framework.composio+2
